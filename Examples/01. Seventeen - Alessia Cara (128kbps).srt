1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:01,840
Oh,

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,406
my daddy says that life comes at you fast we are

3
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:17,722
like blades of grass we come to prime and in time we just wither

4
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:21,914
away and it all changes my view with a looking glass

5
00:00:21,962 --> 00:00:25,670
won't catch pass only photographs from mind us

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,270
of the passing days. Oh, nothing stay

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,726
the same from yesterday. See, I recall being

8
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:36,486
afraid of the dark and holding on a

9
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:40,250
teddy bear. Got to wrap myself in blankets just to cover

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,754
me. From fears that was in and now I'm here

11
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:48,506
and the night is mine to hear me free I

12
00:00:48,528 --> 00:00:51,660
was too young to understand what it means.

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,170
I couldn't wait till I could be 17.

14
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,390
I fought it like when he said, take my time to dream

15
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:09,026
now I wish I could freeze the time at 17 oh

16
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:14,690
1717

17
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,714
now I wish I could freeze the time at seven. My mother

18
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:27,266
said, don't forget where you come from, where you've

19
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:31,530
been. Always keep your closest friends they can't slip away.

20
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,494
They keep you grounded. Oh, keep yourself surrounded

21
00:01:35,622 --> 00:01:39,722
with good advice and yeah, I guess that sounded nice when

22
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:43,118
I was ten. Over never were the true

23
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:47,102
words in all my days I've ever heard? And when she told

24
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:51,038
me little girl answer is love to those words

25
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:54,686
that I keep with me don't even change so quickly?

26
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:58,354
Keep buried in my heart I never thought

27
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,922
dream me free I was

28
00:02:01,976 --> 00:02:04,820
too young to understand what it means.

29
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,350
I couldn't wait till I could be 17.

30
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,606
I thought you, like, take my time.

31
00:02:13,708 --> 00:02:33,662
Breathe now.

32
00:02:33,716 --> 00:02:37,898
I wish I could freeze the time. It's everything I've

33
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:41,120
been going on. I've been going.

34
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,940
I'm in the I don't know enough.

35
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,034
See, I was racing and waiting for that day that I would be old

36
00:02:50,072 --> 00:02:53,170
enough. Guess I'll be facing and pace myself.

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,802
Gotta prepare for when growing up. I was

38
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:59,720
too young. To understand what it means.

39
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,150
I could always be 17.

40
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,430
I thought she like what she said. Take my time to breathe.

41
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:18,150
Now I wish I could freeze the time at 1717.

42
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:28,542
Oh, um now

43
00:03:28,596 --> 00:03:31,790
I wish I could freeze the time at 17.
