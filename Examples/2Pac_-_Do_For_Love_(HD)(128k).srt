1
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:17,150
Amen. You a little stuck up. A love word

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,334
of love. I should have seen

3
00:00:20,372 --> 00:00:23,354
you juggle right from the start. Taught me so many lessons.

4
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:26,966
How not to mess with broken hearts. So many questions. When this began, we was

5
00:00:26,988 --> 00:00:30,646
the perfect match. Perhaps we had some problems, but we were getting at it and

6
00:00:30,668 --> 00:00:34,294
now the arguments are getting loud. I want to stay, but I can't help

7
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:37,462
them walking out. So we're the way. Just take my hand and understand

8
00:00:37,596 --> 00:00:40,754
if you could see I never planned to be your man. It just wasn't

9
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:44,138
me. But now I'm searching for commitment and other arms. I want to

10
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,386
shelter you from home. Don't be alarm. Your attitude was the

11
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:50,854
call you got me stressing soon as I opened up the door with your jealous

12
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:54,310
questions like wicked I be you're killing me with your jealousy

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,582
never mind vicious to be free I can't breathe as soon as I leave

14
00:00:57,636 --> 00:01:00,906
it's like a trap I hear you calling me to come back I'm a sucker

15
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:07,874
for love but

16
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:11,166
you don't what you won't

17
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:15,922
do, you won't do you

18
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:20,514
tried everything but you don't just

19
00:01:20,552 --> 00:01:23,686
when I thought I broke away and I'm feeling happy you try to trap me

20
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,822
say you're pregnant and guess who's? The daddy don't want to fall for it but

21
00:01:26,876 --> 00:01:30,294
in this case what could I do? So now I'm back to making promises to

22
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:33,466
you trying to keep it true what if I'm wrong? A trip to keep me

23
00:01:33,488 --> 00:01:37,274
on and on. Trying to be strong in the process. Keep it going. About to

24
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:40,774
lose my composure. I'm getting close to packing up and leaving notes

25
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:44,214
and getting ghosts. Tell me, who knows a piece of place where I can go

26
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:47,994
to climb my head I'm feeling low, losing control my heart is hanging

27
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:51,466
leave or what a tangle where we weave when we conspire to conceive?

28
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:54,766
And now you're getting calls at the house. Guess you're cheating. That's all I need

29
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:57,934
to hear because I'm leaving. I'm out the dope never know more when

30
00:01:57,972 --> 00:02:01,630
you see me. This is the end because now I know you've been cheating I'm

31
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:22,966
just tears

32
00:02:22,998 --> 00:02:26,326
on your pillow when you steal steak as you sit and pray hoping the beatings

33
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:30,234
would go away it wasn't always a hit and rumble relationship. It used to be

34
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,846
love, happiness and companionship. Remember when I treated

35
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:36,874
you good? I moved you up to the hills out the eels of the ghetto

36
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:39,902
hood. Me and you a happy home. When it was on,

37
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:43,486
I had a lot to call my own, I feel but I

38
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:46,974
was lost trapping your eyes. Biocha power getting tossed. No need.

39
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:50,526
A lie. You had a man and I knew it. You told me. Don't worry

40
00:02:50,558 --> 00:02:53,758
about it. We can do it now. But the pressure. Make a decision because I'm

41
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:57,422
waiting. When I'm alone I'm on the phone having secret conversations

42
00:02:57,566 --> 00:03:01,266
I want to take a misery replace it with happiness but I need your faith

43
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:05,302
in me what

44
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:10,578
you try to name so

45
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:14,540
you ain't right you won't do

46
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,800
you tried everything but you don't know

47
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,806
you tried

48
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:42,242
everything you don't what

49
00:03:42,296 --> 00:03:47,574
you won't do you

50
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:53,000
try to every little bit you

51
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:57,860
try.
